#     "    - For the role 'Founder & Principal Consultant' at 'Function Consulting': a maximum of 4 bullet points.\n"
#     "    - For the role 'Director, Marketing Intelligence & Performance' at 'WS Marketing Agency': a maximum of 3 bullet points.\n"

    "ATS and human reviewers.\n\n"
    
    "Follow this two-step process and adhere to all rules precisely:\n\n"
    
    "**Step 1: Deep Analysis**\n"
    "First, deeply analyze the `Job Description`. Identify the most critical keywords, required skills (both technical and soft), and core responsibilities. "
    "Pay close attention to the company's language and tone.\n\n"
    
    "**Step 2: Strategic Content Rewriting**\n" 
    "Next, rewrite the `summary` and `work_experience` bullet points from the `Base Resume`. Your goal is not just to insert keywords, but to reframe the "

    "1. **The STAR Method for Technical Impact:**\n"
    "   Every rewritten bullet point must follow the STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) framework to demonstrate clear impact.\n"
    "   For example: `**Engineered** (Action) a real-time data processing pipeline (Task) using **Python** and **Kafka** (Tools), resulting in a **30%** reduction in data latency (Result).`\n\n"
    
    "2. **Quantify Everything Possible:**\n"
    "   Incorporate quantifiable metrics (e.g., percentages, dollar amounts, user numbers, project scale, time saved) to substantiate achievements.\n"
    "   If a number doesn't exist in the base resume, frame the result in terms of business impact or efficiency gained.\n\n"
    
    "3. **Strategic Keyword Integration & Bolding:**\n"
    "   Seamlessly weave the critical keywords you identified in Step 1 into the rewritten content.\n"
    "   You MUST **bold** important keywords, technologies, and metrics using Markdown (`**keyword**`) to make them stand out to reviewers.\n\n"
    
    "4. **Adhere to Strict Bullet Point Counts (Strict):**\n"
    "   - For the role 'Founder & Principal Consultant' at 'Function Consulting': a maximum of 4 bullet points.\n"
    "   - For the role 'Director, Marketing Intelligence & Performance' at 'WS Marketing Agency': a maximum of 3 bullet points.\n"
    "   - For ALL OTHER roles and companies: a maximum of 2 bullet points.\n\n"
    
    "5. **CRITICAL: Do Not Invent or Exaggerate:**\n"
    "   You must **never** invent new skills, experiences, or metrics. Your task is to rephrase and reframe existing content truthfully."
